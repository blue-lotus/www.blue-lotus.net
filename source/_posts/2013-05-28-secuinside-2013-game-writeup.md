When I download the file, I found it&#8217;s a simple shooting game like Salamander.  
I guess the target is killing all the enemies.  
After playing a while,the boss came out with 999999 HP.  
Yeah, It&#8217;s a game, so I start to run a popular game cheater Kingsoft Youxia V.  
I use the software search for 999999 in memory and change it to 3, then shoot the boss.

It&#8217;s simple and interesting, isn&#8217;t it?
